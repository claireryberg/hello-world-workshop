<!-- The doctype is a required preamble back from the early 1990s. 
    It was intended to act as a link to a set of validation rules for HTML to do error checking.
    In reality, today it is still required but doesn't really do anything  
  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <html> element wraps all content on the page and is the root element. 
    To be valid it must have only 1 <head> element and 1 <body> element as children
    It also uses the `lang` attribute to set the primary language for the document 
  -->

  <!-- The <head> element contains things that are not visually shown on your page.
    This can be configurations, links to other documents, analytics, etc...

      interpret the written code into the expected letters, numbers, symbols, etc...

    <!-- These attributes set the width of the page to the width of the device being used
      and sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. This prevents mobile
